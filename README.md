# ðŸ§  Izhikevich Neuron Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project simulates a **single neuron** using the **Izhikevich neuron model**. The simulation includes:
- **Generation of Poisson spike trains** as input.
- **Integration of synaptic response currents**.
- **Implementation of spike thresholding** to detect neuron firing.
- **Visualization of neuron membrane potential and recovery variable over time**.

The project provides insights into the dynamics of **biologically inspired spiking neurons** and their behavior under different input conditions.
